# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Correct the spelling of a team member’s name in the Team section (Bennita → Benitta).

**Planned changes:**
- Update the team member name string in `frontend/src/components/site/sections/TeamSection.tsx` from “Bennita” to “Benitta”.
- Ensure the Team section renders “Benitta” everywhere that member’s name appears without changing any other team member details.

**User-visible outcome:** The Team section displays the member name as “Benitta” consistently across the site.
